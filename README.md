Sonr - Find music that finds you

### What is Sonr?  
Sonr is a revolutionary music discovery platform designed to help you find music that resonates with your unique taste. Unlike traditional streaming services that rely on generic algorithms, Sonr uses an intuitive swiping systemâ€”right to like, left to dislike, up for detailed feedback, and down to skip. By offering short previews of songs and collecting nuanced user preferences, Sonr delivers tailored recommendations that go beyond surface-level genre or popularity. It also creates a space for emerging and niche artists to be discovered, connecting listeners with fresh, hidden gems. With Sonr, music finds you.

Sonr solves the issue of boring music recommendations. It allows smaller artists to push their music to the front. It allows users to refind the joy of finding good music, something that has been forgotten in the age of streaming services.

Sonr will integrate with major streaming services to find liked songs and add them straight to your playlist.
