    <p>The platform not only refines user recommendations through granular feedback but also enables artists to showcase the unique details that define their sound—helping listeners discover them beyond basic genres.

      Sonr puts the focus on the sound, not how many streams or followers the artist has. Our detailed recommendations off of mood, tempo and more mean that we can recommend music based off of the music.</p>
